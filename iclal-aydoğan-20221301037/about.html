            <div class="about-metni">I can introduce myself as a designer with a strong intuitive side. I am closely interested in many branches of art such as painting, poetry, architecture and music. I was born in 2003 in Alanya/Antalya. Two years ago i moved to Istanbul for university. I am currently studying architecture at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University.
                 The fact that place where I grew up was surrounded by nature connected me to life and thus to art. I believe that the most valuable thing people can do with their lives is to be remembered. Therefor the reason why I chose to study architecture was my desire to be able to touch people's lives and leave concrete and perhaps permanent works to the world in which we visit for a short time. 
                 You can check out my page and see some of my works in categories and get to know me and my style better!</div>
